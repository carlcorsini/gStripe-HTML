# HTML

## **Hypertext Markup Language**

the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications

##### What is HTML?

* Gives structure to web pages
* Creates visual aspect of web pages
* Released in 1993 - still in heavy use today
* Nodes/Tree Structure
* Contains many "tags" eg. "<h1></h1>"
* Tricky at first - especially with no coding background
* It is it's own language with tons of functionality that allows developers to organize/structure web pages.

##### Lesson

In this lesson we will design a basic web page just like the ones we used to see on our dial up computers 10-20 years ago. (a lot has changed/improved in a short time)

##### Goals

* Understand HTML Boiler Plate
  * "html" tags
    * the highest level node of an html document
    * everything will go inside the html tags
  * "head" tags
    * the information your document needs to function
      * Title
      * charset
      * style or link tags
  * "body" tags
    * this is where you will create the structure and the actual content on your web page
    * You will have tree like structures containing organizational or content tags like "div" or "p" for structure

##### Tasks

* Create a basic HTML boilerplate and insert a title for your web page

* Create all of the functioning div tags within your HTML document:

  1.  Header <h1>

      * the header will be the title of your website (maybe use the same title from the title tagâ€¦ up to you)

  2.  Paragraph <p>

      * This is where the body of your text will go
      * Each time you need a new paragraph you will create a new paragraph tag

  3.  Div <div>

      * div tags help divide your html document up into sections.
      * helps keep similar information organized

  4.  Form <form>

      * Forms are made up of many different components.
      * you know those pesky payment forms you come across every day? Someone had to write the code in order for them to function
      * forms are made up of inputs, buttons and other tags for styling etc.

  5.  Input <input>

      * there are many differnt kinds of inputs
      * You come across these every day, if you log in to a website you are entering text into a text-input
      * inputs include: checkbox, radios, text-area, text-box, dropdown etc.

  6.  Button <button>

      * submit button
        * submits form after user has input information
      * Button (toggle)
        * custom function tied to the button being pressed (the click event)
